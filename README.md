#### ansible_basics
  * Ansible is flexible and easy to set up as far as configuration deployment management system go
  * Ansible doesn't require any server component. There is no daemon that needs to be running. It does all of its work over SSH.
  * Where-ever you are going to run your playbooks from, you need to have ansible installed. But your resulting nodes which you may be running commands on do not need to have ansible installed (they just need to be accessible with the help of SSH). 
  
#### Commands
  * sudo su --first go to root
